                    International cultures and governments are increasingly recognizing the LGBTQ community and have
                    begun providing those in the LGBTQ community with equal rights — such as same-sex marriages and
                    non-discrimination policies.

                  <p>
                    While a positive step in the right direction, many parts of the world continue to uphold
                    outdated and unfair beliefs and policies that inhibit LBGTQ couples from legally starting families
                    in their home countries.

                    The basic hormone tests for fertility issues will help you learn if you have any conditions that
                    should be treated before you can get pregnant, whether you’re ovulating, and your ovarian reserve.
                    Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) will help assess whether or not your Fallopian tubes are open and healthy.
              </p>
                  <p>
                    Treatment may be as simple as intrauterine insemination (IUI) (also known as artificial insemination)
                    using donor sperm from an anonymous or known donor. For women with diminished ovarian reserves or tubal
                    or pelvic factors, in vitro fertilization (IVF) may provide the best chance for pregnancy.

                  <h5>INTRAUTERINE INSEMINATION (IUI)</h5>
                  <p>
                    IUI increases the number of sperm that can reach the Fallopian tube, subsequently increasing the
                    chance of fertilization. This treatment offers sperm an advantage by giving it a head start.
                    Sperm also bypasses the cervical mucus that in some cases inhibits the sperm progression.
                    Best results are achieved when the IUI is performed exactly at the time of spontaneous ovulation.
                    An artificial ovulation trigger in form of hCG (pregnancy hormone) can further optimize insemination timing.
            </p>
                  <h5>IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF)</h5>
                  <p>
                    A more advanced procedure, in vitro fertilization (IVF) refers to when a physician will remove eggs
                    from your ovaries. These eggs are fertilized by sperm inside the lab. IVF has the highest success rate
                    of treatments that use your own eggs or sperm.
            </p>
                  <h5>RECIPROCAL IVF (CO-IVF)</h5>
                  <p>
                    During this treatment, both females in a couple have the opportunity to use their eggs or carry the pregnancy.
                    The couple can choose to use the same egg/sperm source, thus giving birth to 100% genetic siblings,
                    or create embryos from each female.
            </p>
                  <h5>DONOR EGG TREATMENT</h5>
                  <p>
                    Donor egg treatment involves an IVF cycle during which a female uses another female’s eggs other than her own.
                    Egg donors are healthy females ages 21 to 32 who are medically, genetically, and psychologically prescreened
                    and ready to anonymously donate.

                    Pregnancy help using donor eggs combined with gestational surrogacy are options for couples in the LGBT community.
                    A gestational carrier is a woman with no genetic tie with the child she is carrying and who have been thoroughly
                    screened in advance. The average wait to be matched with a GC is 3-6 months. All GCs must seek legal counsel,
                    even when working with a friend or family member.

                    While gay men have faced more biological and financial challenges in becoming parents,
                    there are ways to overcome many of these barriers! In order to have a biological child,
                    a gay man needs a female gestational carrier who will carry the baby. In traditional surrogacy,
                    the surrogate is inseminated with one of the male’s sperm and is the biological mother of the child.
                    In gestational surrogacy, donor eggs from another female are fertilized with the man’s sperm in the embryology lab.
                    The resulting embryos are then transferred to the surrogate’s uterus.

                    carry the pregnancy.

                    forward with a transition, you have many options for future genetic children. If prior to transition, we may recommend freezing your eggs

                    Testosterone therapy usually leads to anovulatory state and amenorrhea, which is sometimes reversible upon discontinuation of testosterone therapy.

                    For transgender women, current research suggests that prolonged estrogen exposure of the testes may result in damage.
