                    During your first appointment, the doctor will perform beginning
                    tests such as blood tests or an ultrasound:
                  </p>

                  <h5>Blood Tests</h5>
                  <ul className="list-section">
                    <li>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) – stimulates the ovaries to mature an egg</li>
                    <li><a href="/amh99" className="links-inline">AMH (Anti Mullerian Hormone)</a> – indicates the size of a woman’s ovarian reserve <a href="/amh99" className="links-inline">(utilize our AMH $99 special)</a></li>
                    <li>Estradiol – prepares the uterine lining for implantation</li>
                    <li>Luteinizing hormone (LH) – stimulates the release of eggs from the ovaries</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>Ultrasound</h5>
                  <p>
                    Transvaginal ultrasound tests allow our fertility specialists to assess the health of your ovaries, uterus,
                    and follicles. This process begins with the doctor gently inserting an ultrasound probe vaginally,
                    examining ovaries and endometrial lining. Results can show possible reasons for difficulties conceiving, such as:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-section">
                    <li>Low egg reserve</li>
                    <li>PCOS</li>
                    <li>Fibroids</li>
                    <li>Thin lining in the uterus</li>
                    <li>Cysts</li>
                    <li>Polyps</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    If further steps are needed, the next test might include a hydrosonogram or hysterosalpingogram:
                  </p>

                  <h5>Ultrasound</h5>

                  <p>
                    – This procedure begins similarly to a pap smear and
                    has similarities to Hysterosalpingograms (minus the dye and x-ray portion).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    – The doctor inserts a speculum and saline is inserted into the vagina. The saline fills the uterine area and,
                    simultaneously, the doctor will insert the ultrasound probe vaginally and perform a transvaginal ultrasound.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    – It shows the inside of the uterus and whether the fallopian tubes are open.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    – HSG examine the walls of your uterus and fallopian tubes, which allows us to see whether your
                    fallopian tubes are open, check for the presence of fibroids, and assess the shape of your uterus.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    – A dye is inserted into the vagina and enters the uterus. The uterine area accumulates dye and,
                    if the fallopian tubes are open, dye will fill the tubes and enter the abdominal area.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    – An x-ray shows where the dye goes after entering the uterus, which reveals whether the fallopian tubes are open or blocked,
                    and, if blocked, the location of the blockage.
                  </p>
